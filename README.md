## Introduction

Clustering is a common problem encountered in data analysis, and it gets especially challenging for high dimensional data. 
Moreover, it is difficult to identify the optimal cluster size in parametric models such as the k-means algorithm in these problems.

Therefore, we are proposing Dirichlet Process Mixture Model, a Bayesian nonparametric
approach that not only assumes no fixed cluster size and has unbounded complexity but also provides
interpretability to the clustering model as it estimates the underlying distribution of the data. 
Our approach can provide an effecitve alternative approach for real-life machine learning applications with high-dimensional data, 
ranging from profiling grouping to social media analysis.
